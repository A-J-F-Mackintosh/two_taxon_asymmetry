# two taxon asymmetry
This repository contains Mathematica and python notebooks associated with Mackintosh and Setter (2024), as well as a python script to estimate A<sub>m</sub> from a VCF file.

The Mathematica notebook shows how the generating function of genealogical branch lengths (Lohse et al. 2011) can be used to obtain (both marginal and conditional) expectations for the length of external branches, and therefore A<sub>m</sub>.
